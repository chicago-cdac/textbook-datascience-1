To do this, we must extract the data for the years of interest from the column containing the data pertaining to GDP percentage of military spending in Canada. We will call this `can_gdp`. Then, we can call the `plt.bar()` function to create a bar chart using this data. The `plt.bar()` function needs two arguments. The first argument, `x`, can be an array of values that will be plotted on the x-axis. The second argument, `height`, determines the height of the bars and is essentially the y-values. We can create a list of our years of interest and call it `years` to input as the first argument. We can use `can_gdp` as our second argument."

    "## Pie chart\n",
    "\n",
    "Pie charts are a commonly used visualization method to represent proportions in datasets. Pie charts use *wedges* to represent the numerical value of a proportion corresponding to a categorial variable. While pie charts are very common and can be easily interpreted by a layperson audience, they may not be the best way to represent data in certain cases. Firstly, because pie charts use the area of a circle to represent the proportion of a categorical variable, it can be difficult to gauge the numerical value that a wedge represents if the area doesn't appear as an easily discernible fraction (i.e. 1/2, 1/3, 1/4). This can be aided with the help of labels and legends that explicitly show the numerical values associated with the wedges of the pie chart. Secondly, if you want to visualize many categorical variables or variables that make up a significantly small proportion of the dataset, it may be difficult to see the variable on a pie chart. Overall, pie charts can be a simple and effective way to communicate proportional categorical data, but before using them, consider what attributes of the data need to be highlighted to help decide if a pie chart is the most appropriate visualization method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's look at the total amount of money spent on the military in the entire North American continent for the year of 2020 and determine what proportion of this total amount came from each country. To do this, we will need to extract data for the year 2020 and call it `pie2020`. Then, we can  make a pie chart using the `plt.pie()` funtion. We will use `pie2020` to determine the wedge sizes and the argument `normalize=True` to normalize the data to 1. We'll also set the figure size using `plt.figure()`."

To do this, we can create a list called `countries`,  containing the strings \"Canada\", \"Mexico\", and \"USA\". We can then assign the `labels` argument within `plt.pie()` to `countries`.

    "In this section, we were introduced the the `plt.bar()` and `plt.pie()` functions to construct bar plots and pie charts, respectively. The `plt.bar()` function requires `x` and `height` arguments, which can be an array of number values, but other parameters can be included. The `plt.pie()` function only requires an `x` argument as an array of values and has other arguments that can be included as well. Both of these types of visualizations are used for depicting categorical data. As a reminder, when deciding on whether to use a pie chart, consider certain attributes of the data, such as the number of categorical variables or the size of the proportions to be plotted.
