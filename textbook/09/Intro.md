Randomness and Sampling
====================
Whether modeling a real-world example like rolling dice or tossing a coin, or randomly selecting a subset of a population for a survey, the process of selecting a choice from a list of options at random is very useful! This chapter will focus on the foundations of random selection, including how to implement a random choice in Python, and extend this random sampling to DataFrames.

Additionally, we introduce control statements, which allow us to select or iterate a statement or process.

We'll ultilize these ideas to *simulate* experiments, or imitate real-world examples using code.
