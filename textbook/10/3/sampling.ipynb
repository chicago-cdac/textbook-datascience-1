    "# Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "In both experimental and observational studies, the goal is to come to a conclusion about a certain *population*. That population may consist of cancer patients, residents of Hyde Park, or students in this data science course. A survey of every *unit* – or individual member – of a population is known as a *census*. Often, it is not possible to collect data on every subject in a population. For example, I may be able to survey all students in this course, but it would be difficult to survey every Hyde Park resident. This is due to logistical issues, the amount of time it would take, and the expense. For these reasons, researchers often study a *sample* of the population and use that sample to gain information about the entire population through statistical inference. Numerical characteristics of the sample are known as a *statistics*. Statistics are used to estimate or infer values of *parameters*, which are numerical characteristics of the entire population.\n",

    "## Sampling Designs\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be able to generalize from the sample to the population as a whole, the sample must be *representative* of the population. Otherwise, inference on that sample may produce misleading conclusions. For example, if a researcher is interested in understanding how those living on the southside of Chicago view the University of Chicago, and the researcher collects a sample of 50 first years attending the University of Chicago, the feelings of this sample of first years is most likely not representative of the feelings of everyone living on the southside. Similarly, if a cancer researcher wants to know how well a drug works on cancer patients, but uses a sample consisting only of men under 30, any conclusions she might draw from the experiment cannot be generalized to the entire population but rather only to the population of men under 30. When a sample is not representative of the population it is considered *biased*.\n",

    "### Simple Random Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several *sampling designs*, or processes by which a sample is collected, that are meant to help collect representative samples. The first is a *simple random sample (SRS)*. In a simple random sample of size `n`, every group of `n` units in the population has an equal chance of being selected as the sample. This ensures that portions of the population are not over- or under-sampled. The figure below shows a simple random sample of 10 units (shown in maroon) taken from a population of 100.\n",

    "For example, suppose I have five colored marbles in a hat and I draw one marble from the hat without looking. All marbles have the same chance of being selected, one in five. Therefore, my marble choosing example is an SRS. We can conduct an SRS easily in python using a function from the `numpy` library called `random.choice`. The following code uses `np.random.choice` to randomly select a color from the array `marbles` [^*]. By default, it will conduct an SRS, meaning that all elements in `marbles` have an equal chance of being chosen. "

    "SRS are very useful in practice as they allow a researcher to mathematically or computationally quantify variation due to sampling (*i.e.* the precision of a statistic). The downside of SRS is that it requires a *sampling frame*, or list of names or IDs of all units in a population. In our marble example, the sampling frame was our `marbles` array and had a size of 5. Aquiring such a sampling frame is impractical for large populations. Now that we have experimented with simple random sampling, we will introduce a few more sampling designs that make use of simple random samples.\n",

    "Stratified samples allow a researcher to gain more exact information than SRS of the same size, by ensuring that each stratum is equally represented in the sample. Many universities employ stratified random sampling when conducting surveys gauging student or faculty opinions. Those conducting the survey split the population of university students into strata by year (*e.g.* first years, second years, third years, and fourth years); then, they take a simple random sample of students from each stratum. This sampling design works well when cases within a stratum are similar but there are large differences between strata. However, it has the same downside as a SRS as it too needs sampling frames for each stratum.\n",

    "### Multistage Sampling\n",

    "The next type of sampling we will discuss, *multistage sampling*, conducts sampling in stages and is often used for large nationwide samples of households or individuals. The major advantage of multistage sampling is that it does not require a complete sampling frame. For example, consider a polling company interested in obtaining a generalizable sample of American households. First, they might stratify households by state to ensure sampling from each state. Within states, they might cluster households by county and take a simple random sample of those counties. Lastly, they take a simple random sample of `n` households from each of the sampled counties. This sampling strategy is depicted below. Multistage sampling mixes stratified and cluster sampling in stages and, as a result, the researcher never requires a list of all households in the US, but rather a sampling frame of US counties and then a sampling frame of households within a much smaller subset of US counties.\n",

    "There are two sampling designs that suffer from a lack of generalizability yet sometimes cannot be avoided. The first is known as a *convenience sample*. A convenience sample is, as its name suggests, a sample that is collected out of ease of access for the researchers. Looking through research in psychology in particular, many researchers collect a convenience sample of students from introductory psychology courses. Though this is an easy way of gathering a sample, it is not the most generalizable, as introductory psychology students are likely not representative of the broader population the researchers seek to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "A second example of a sampling design that is not generalizable is the *voluntary response sample*, where participants volunteer to be part of the study. Restaurant reviews provide a nice example of a voluntary response sample. Those with strong opinions of the restaurant (either positive or negative) are more likely to write reviews. Voluntary response samples oversample those who feel strongly about the topic being studied and undersample those who do not care as much. These samples are always *biased*, or not representative of the broader population."
