# Empirical Distributions, Inference, and Simulation

In the previous chapter we discussed different types of experiments and how sampling can be used to make inferences about a population. However, it is often difficult or expensive to conduct experiments or even to find observational data on certain phenomena. In these cases, scientists often *simulate* data instead. We saw a few examples of simulation and inference previously. In this chapter we will build on the concepts of randomness and sampling that we have learned to investiate empirical distributions, inference, and the usefulness of simulating real-world data.
