    "Simulations are used to imitate real-world scenarios. They can have many roles, ranging from obtaining insight into a physical system to testing and training of models and algorithms. In this chapter, we will use simulations to estimate probabilities. We will explore other applications later, such as gaining insight into probability distributions.\n",

    "In the birthday problem described at the beginning of this chapter (30 people at a party), the only information that is needed for deciding on matching birthdays is the set of birthdates. The simulation we will construct will focus on that - we just need a function that generates 30 random birthdays. It turns out we have already seen a function in Python (and in `numpy`) that can do that: `random.choice` (and `random.choices`).\n",
